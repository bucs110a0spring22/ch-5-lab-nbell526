## SUMMARY:
My program runs a simulation of a dart board in three parts. The first part, Part A, randomly simulates darts being thrown a dartborard, showing up 'blue' when it hits the board and 'orange' if it misses. Part B runs a game between 2 players, then indicates whihc player has one the game based off who hit teh dart board more times. Part C asks for 'the number of darts to be thrown in the simulation', which then runs that number of darts thrown at the board. Using the equation given in the code, an approximation of pi is given using the amount of darts input.
